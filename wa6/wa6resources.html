      <h1>What's the Problem?</h1>

      <p>
        Getting into waterfowl hunting on Colorado's public lands by yourself can be tough! Limited access, 
        high competition, specialized gear, and a steep learning curve often leave newcomers frustrated. Without 
        community support and shared knowledge, it's easy to waste time in unproductive spots. That's why Colorado 
        Public Waterfowlers exists: to make the sport more accessible, enjoyable, and successful for everyone.
        <br><br>
        We provide guidance, shared experiences, and a supportive community to help you navigate the challenges.
