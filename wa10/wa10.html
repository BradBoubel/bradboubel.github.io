        My Extension:<br><br>
        For Weekly Activity 10, I chose to implemet a similar API that generates random quotes that Donald Trump says. The changes
        for CSS that were implemeted are: style changed to fit the narative, boxes added to a container class so I could flex them over
        each other horizontally. For the HTML I added another div for the paragraph elements and a picture of Trump speaking so that it
        looks like he is saying the quotes.
      </p>

        How Could I Implement This:<br><br>
        I think that the implementation of a weather and migration API could be useful in helping users have any data they may want
        in a single tab. For the weather API, users would be able to access data local to them by inputting a zip code for with they
        would like data. For the migration API, I would like to have a box that shows a map of North America as a whole, showing a heat
        style graphic of the data.
